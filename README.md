## DS & Algo Topics

This section contains an organised set of resources, divided into topics, and categorised by the level of complexity(actual, not computational! Lol.)

### Beginner

> Topics for people getting started with Competitive Programming.

### Intermediate

> Topics for people with some experience with CP, but a desire to go above and beyond.

### Advanced

> Topics related to highly important concepts and algorithms that are used for solving the most difficult of problems.

*Happy Learning and may the source be with you! :zap: *
